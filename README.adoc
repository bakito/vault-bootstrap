## About

This Go Tool can be used to initialize Vault. It can perform the following steps:

* Vault initilazation
* Save Root Token and Unseal Keys to K8s Secret
* Vault unseal 
* Enable Kubernetes authentication

## Disclaimer
In this version, the Vault token and unseal Keys can only be saved to a Kubernetes secret. This is insecure and this deployment is *ONLY SUITED FOR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS*.
However, this tool can be extended to save Vault token and unseal Keys to a different secret engine (Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, another Vault instance). 

## Usage

The container image is hosted at quay.io in the following repo: *quay.io/radudd/vault-bootstrap*

To install Vault Bootstrap to OpenShift or Kubernetes, deploy the following Job:

```
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f 

kind: Job
apiVersion: batch/v1

  name: vault-init

  template:
